            I am an Applied Physics student in my third year, specializing in computer physics with a focus on the nuclear field. I am also a certified AI expert, with a specialization in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. My experience includes working on various AI projects, from enterprise-class endeavors such as unstandardized document classification using OCR combined with LLMs (like Llama3) to smaller personal projects. I excel in creating applications with APIs, such as Azure OpenAI, using open-source technologies like LangChain, and training smaller LLMs like Meta Llama and Mistral locally for specific use cases. With two years of experience in AI, I have a deep understanding of its mechanics and current limitations. Outside of academics, I am passionate about sports, having been a former professional swimmer, and aquaristics.

            I am an Applied Physics student in my third year, specializing in computer physics with a focus on complex systems analysis. I am a software developer with expertise in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a solid understanding of generative AI. My experience includes training CNNs for document classification and developing a comprehensive website (peopleofequality.pl) with a database for a company. My main skills encompass:

            Developing and training CNN models
            Backend and frontend software development
            Rigorous software testing
            In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about classical music and playing piano(graduated music school), and physics, as evidenced by my achievement as a finalist in the national physics olympiad.
